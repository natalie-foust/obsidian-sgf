# Obsidian SGF

This is a plugin for reading [Smart Game Format\(SGF\) Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format) in Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It is currently just a project that I may or may not complete but I figured I would make it public in case anyone else wants to use it.


NOTE: wgo.js seems poorly documented. We might have better luck with [shudan](https://github.com/SabakiHQ/Shudan)


On further examination, [godash](https://github.com/duckpunch/godash/) would probably be the best backend. It's basic , intuitive and seems well maintained. Check the [godash api](https://duckpunch.github.io/godash/api/) to learn how to use it. The author of it wrote a simple react frontend for it called [react-go-board](https://github.com/duckpunch/react-go-board). Depending on how much react is compatible with obsidian, I could use that.

Anyway, here's a little react project that I started to try it out and it seems pretty intuitive:

(I saved the code in readme.extension.js.md just in case I lose the react project for some reason).
